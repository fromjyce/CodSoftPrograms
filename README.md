# Java Programming Intern at CodSoft
Explore my GitHub repository, a collection of projects crafted during my Java programming internship at CodSoft. These projects encapsulate my journey, showcasing skills such as number generation and user interaction in the "Number Game", grade calculation in "The Student Grade Calculator", user-friendly interfaces in "ATM Interface", real-time data integration in "Currency Converter", and efficient data management in "Student Management System". Together, they trace my evolution from intern to adept Java programmer, offering a concise narrative of my growth and expertise.

## Structure of the Repository
### Task One : [`Guess The Number`](https://github.com/fromjyce/CodSoftPrograms/blob/main/GuessNumber.java)
I created a program that generated a random number within a specified range. Users were prompted to guess the number, and the program provided feedback until they guessed correctly. I also added features such as limiting attempts, enabling multiple rounds, and displaying a user score based on attempts or rounds won.

### Task Two: [`The Student Grade Calculator`](https://github.com/fromjyce/CodSoftPrograms/blob/main/StudentGradeCalculator.java)
I developed a program that allowed me to input marks for various subjects. The program calculated total marks, average percentage, and assigned grades based on the average. It presented the results, including total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grades.

### Task Three: [`ATM Interface`](https://github.com/fromjyce/CodSoftPrograms/tree/main/ATMInterface)
I designed an ATM simulation, complete with a user interface for options like withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. By creating classes for both the ATM and user bank accounts, I was able to handle transactions effectively. I ensured that user inputs were validated and displayed the outcomes of each transaction.

### Task Four: [`Real-Time Currency Converter`](https://github.com/fromjyce/CodSoftPrograms/blob/main/CurrencyConverter.java)
Crafted a currency converter using [`Apilayer`](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/exchangerates_data-api) API, allowing base-to-target currency selection, real-time exchange rates fetching, accurate conversions, and clear result display with target currency symbols.

### Task Five: `Student Management System`
I created a Student class with attributes and leveraged JavaFX to design a user-friendly interface. The system facilitated tasks like adding, editing, and displaying student details while ensuring user inputs were accurately validated. Data storage mechanisms were implemented to maintain information integrity.
